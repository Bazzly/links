Hello, welcome to my passionate world.
I will try to update my journey here as I will be re-learning my PHP development skills from scratch without any framework.
I feel like I have forgotten all my PHP SKILLS lol.
I have used been using larval framework for more than 5 years and today I want to start PHP from scratch, but this time I will document all, my journey to help others who might like to start learning PHP in the future.

*****STEP 1 MAY 11 2021*****
I WILL START BY CHECKING AND INSTALLING/UPDATING XAMP APPLICATION ON MY MACBOOK AIR COMPUTER.
